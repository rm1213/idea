# Provision of cheap technology to Indian Villages and districts
Even though technology is easily accessible for people living in cities in India,for people living in districts and villages access to technology is still difficult.Even though,despite having electricity,many people in small districts and towns consider technology as something really big and amusing thing.Primarily for education and health-care.One of the ideas to tackle this issue is the use of cheap and durable smart bots.These bots can work on secondary battery storage and make it easy for people sitting in cities to connect easily to village and district people.Also,interaction between the trainer and people could be initiated.Machine Learning could help to teach bots even the dynamic conditions of the places and could help the people living in citites to get a clear picture of the place and standard of living.Same could be aplicable for health-care too.By the time,people wait to move from district to citites,people involved in health-care could provide better suggestions to people via the bot and if required further the people can be shifted to cities.Bots could also be trained to teach in absence of trainers too.Also,minor diagnosis of people could be done by bots too,rather than requiring several equipments,if they could try to collect some information regarding people.All-in-all the gap between villages and cities to be reduced should be the main objective of employing bots.
